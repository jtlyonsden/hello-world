# hello-world
Dipping my toes in.

I've visited GitHub numerous times to get help with third-party plugins, but I've never created an account or tried to collaborate. I'm a graphic designer, but I love to dabble with coding. Sometims it's more than just dabbling when I'm developing for the web (PHP, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, etc.). But I also like playing around with Apple's Swift for iOS. I haven't created anything cool yet, but I hope to change that.
